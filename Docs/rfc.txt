1.  Introduction

   This document provides a full documentation for the Network Game
   Protocol of the R-Type Game.

   It provides all the necessary information to understand how to
   communicate with a R-Type server and with a R-Type client: commands,
   protocols, packets format...

   It also explains when to use the TCP and the UDP network protocols
   when you are communicating with a R-Type client or with a R-Type
   server.

2.  Transfert Description

   The R-Type Network Communication Protocol is based on the TCP and UDP
   network protocols.

   The R-Type Network Communication is a binary protocol.

2.1.  TCP

   The TCP protocol is used for all the commands that are not related to
   a game action.

   Basically, all the commands that are related to the client's menu
   (list games, create game, delete game, ...) must be sent by using the
   TCP network protocol.

   This protocol has been chosen to provide a safe client-server
   communication for important commands

2.2.  UDP

   The UDP protocol is used for all the commands that are related to a
   game action.

   Basically, all movements informations are transmitted by using the
   UDP network protocol.

   This protocol has been chosen to provide a fast and efficient client-
   server communication

   Each command is formatted by using the following diagram: a common
   header and a specific body.

   This configuration must be implemented by both TCP and UDP
   communication.

   |-------------------------|
   | HEADER |      BODY      |
   |-------------------------|

3.1.  Header

   The header is composed of a magic_code and of an instruction code.

   |-------------------------------|
   | magic_code | instruction_code |
   |   int32_t  |      int32_t     |
   |-------------------------------|

   The magic_code must have a value of 0x150407CA.  If it doesn't, the
   packet must be considered as invalid and the connection must be
   closed.

   The instruction_code corresponds to a specific value depending of the
   command.  It must be used to know what is the size of the packet's
   body.

3.2.  Body

   The packet's body contains a c-structure data which depends of the
   command that has been sent.

   Each command has its own structure with a different size and
   different fields.

4.  TCP Commands

4.1.  handshake

   Instruction code: 0x0A

4.1.1.  From Client

   This command must be sent just after beeing connecting to the R-Type
   server.

   It informs the server that you are a valid R-Type client.

   Until you send this command, the other commands you'll send may not
   be treated by the server.

   This command does not have a body.

4.1.2.  From Server

   This command must be sent just after accepting a R-Type client.

   It informs the client that you are a valid R-Type server.

   Until you send this command, the other commands you'll send may not
   be treated by the client.

   This command does not have a body.

4.2.  createGame

   Instruction code: 0x01

4.2.1.  From Client

   This command is used to create a new game on the server.

   This command is composed of the following body:

   |-------------------------------------------------|
   |   name   | levelName | nbPlayers | nbSpectators |
   | char[64] |  char[64] |   char    |     char     |
   |-------------------------------------------------|

   The name attribute is the name you want to give to the created game.

   The levelName attribute is the name of the level script you want to
   use.

   The nbPlayers attribute is the maximum number of players who can play
   to the created game.  This number must be between 1 and 4.

   The nbSpectators attribute is the maximum number of spectators who
   can attend to the created game.  This number must be between 1 and 4.

   The server must answer with an error command packet.

   In case of success, the client becomes the owner of the game and can
   delete it.

   The ownership can not be given to an other client.
